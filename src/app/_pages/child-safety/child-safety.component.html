      <p>Themillskorner is a leader in child safety and fully complies with the Childrenâ€™s Privacy Protection Act.
        Protecting the young people we work with is our top priority. We do this by performing identity verification
        and criminal and sex-offender background checks on all potential mentors, monitoring and filtering
        communications through DOJ and FBI state-of-the-art system, and requiring our mentors to notify us of any
        inappropriate, illegal or potentially endangering communications.</p>
      <p>TheMillsKorner mentors are required to pass a thorough background check in order to participate in
        themillskorner. This includes a National Criminal Check, a National Sex Offender Check and an Identification
        Verification.</p>
